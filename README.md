# rock-paper-scissors

This is my attempt at the Rock Paper Scissors assignment as outlined in The Odin Project:

The initial commit will only be focussing on the javascript game logic, as we are expected to return to design a front end in a later lesson. I will update with a pages link at that point.

I had do some internet detective work here for a few things (like randomization for the computer selection), but the trial and error of making my way through this assignment from scratch(ish) was a very educational and fun project.

I have updated the UI to use buttons for player selections instead of a prompt, as instructed in the "Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors" class.

Although I didn't use much DOM manipulation or CSS styling, this was a pretty fun assignment because I had to change some of the game logic in order to work with button selections instead of a user prompt loop. It was a good educational assignment that helped further my understanding of the javascript syntax and functions.
