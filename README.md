# rock-paper-scissors

This is my attempt at the Rock Paper Scissors assignment as outlined in The Odin Project:

The initial commit will only be focussing on the javascript game logic, as we are expected to return to design a front end in a later lesson. I will update with a pages link at that point.

I had do some internet detective work here for a few things (like randomization for the computer selection), but the trial and error of making my way through this assignment from scratch(ish) was a very educational and fun project.
